code is initialize using

GPIO Initialization

I2C2 initilize for Sensor

SPI initialize for external EEPROM 

USART2 initialize for Debug messages

ADC initialization for touch sensing

Timer22 initialize with diffrent intrupt timming for sampling and diffrent stages
		//1.6ms is the intruppet timing whrn taking samples from sensor
		
1) At the start MPU9250 is reset by calling  resetMPU9250(); // Reset registers to default in preparation for device calibration

2) Gyro and Accelero is calibrated using calibrateMPU9250(gyroBias, accelBias); // Calibrate gyro and accelerometers, load biases in bias registers  

3)MPU9250 is initialize not magnatometer using  initMPU9250();

4) Magnatometer is initalize using initAK8963(magCalibration);

5) Program has three main steps and keeps running between one of these three stages 
	// for these three stages three diffrent veriables are used 
	/******** variables******//
	# program_start
	# first
	# read
	# init_seq // it is required to check in timer intrupt to see that sensor has been initializ
	$$ at the start all three variables are at false condition 
	
	#first the code checks the program_start variable and perform these task after reset and every complet read out 
	
	**first it waits for the touch and will not forward untill a touch is detected
	** after the touch is detected timer22(TIM22) is initialse with a timer intrupt of 1.6ms
	** variables for EEPROM address are initalize to zero for pointing to page 0(zero) first page
	** Flash must be erased Completly before any new writing is to be done
	** for erase command to be completed a delay of 1.5(seconds) is required before writing can be done 
	
	** init_seq is set to 1 or true and programm_start is also set to true and this loop is exit and program now run
	** based on intrupt and run in main while loop  now in timer intrupt samples are collected in the following sequence
	
					** on every intruppt a call back function is called 
					****void HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim)***
					**program check "init_seq" and that "read" is false
					** first 6 register are read for accelero and place in "sensor_data[]"array 
						and variable samples is used dor counting number of samples
					** then 6 Gyro register are read and place in the same array and sample count is incremented
					** then 6 magnatometer registers are read and place in same arry and sample count is incremented
					
					**At the end of 13 intrupts the sample count has reaached "252" so loop check this
					** and in last three places "0" is place in array and can be used for placing tempratur of MPU9250
					
					**after 256 sampples are collected  during the intrupt it checks if "read" false 
					** a seprat arry is formulated with page program command and eeprom addres 
					** that is  Flash_Store();//formulate array with page command and address of location increment 255 after every call

	## Variable ""first"" is used in function "Flash_store()" for detecting so that page address should be all zero at start
	
		**after formulating the array 255 bytes are writen on the first page of EEPROM and checke is used
		** for detecting the maximum EEPROM page adress
	
	##After EEPROM is full variable "read" is set to true so it can be checkd in main loop to read the full memory 
		**while the "read" is true programm waits for another touch so data can be 
		** outputed on the USART to PC
		** after all the data is transmitted programm  return to "program_start" satge
		** and wait for new touch to start sensor recording
